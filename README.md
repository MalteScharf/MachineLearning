# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Algorithms (Sklearn)

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithm implementations in **Python** using **scikit-learn**. It was developed to support the coursework for the [Introduction to Machine Learning (EML)](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/mi/studium/module/eml.shtml) module at **FernUniversitÃ¤t in Hagen**.
