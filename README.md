# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Algorithms (Sklearn)

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithm implementations in **Python** using **scikit-learn**. It was developed to support the coursework for the [Empirical Machine Learning (EML)](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/mi/studium/module/eml.shtml) module at **FernUniversitÃ¤t in Hagen**.

## ðŸ“š About the Project

In this project, I implemented various core machine learning techniques including:

- Supervised Learning:
  - Classification
  - Regression
  - Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Model Evaluation

The code is structured and documented to help students understand how these algorithms work and how to apply them using Python and scikit-learn.
